# Summary
### Task-1: we are created our own react element & render method, react element(object) that contain type,props and children

```javascript
      const obj = {
       type : '',
       props : {},
       children : ''
      }
      method
      renderMethod(obj,root)
      {
        //create element 
        // set properties
        // set children
        // append to root
      }
```

### Task-2: In vite project we are rendering App and it is function then we create similar function and render it âœ…


    <MyApp> == MyApp() but not preferrable

    we can't render object like <Myobj> -> in this case MyObj is same as Our task-1 object 
    
    it not work because react render method have some special properties or rules that we need to follow
    so we can't render object like <MyObj>
    
    but we can render MyObj with jsx means direct
    MyObj=(<a href="http://google.com">Google</a>) something 
    because at the end it convert jsx in to tree and then render it simple by MyObj 
### t-3 : then we are created custome ele but using react

```javascript
      react.createElement(
      'type', // div , a , p , h1 ,
      {}, // props
        '',// children
        var  // evaluted expression 
      )  
```  
in react we can access value as {var}
